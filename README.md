# Don't Kill Santa

This is a game written originally written for the [12 Seconds of Christmas](https://itch.io/jam/12-seconds-of-christmas-game-jam-2024) game jam.

After originally writing the game in C, however, I decided that I wanted to explore more languages and frameworks and so have decided to rewrite it again and again.

You can find a standalone game with its build instructions in each directory.

## Why?

I'm old to software engineering, but new to game development. Before I try my hand at a real game (if I ever do), I wanted to explore various languages and frameworks to see which suits me best.

I chose this game because it is short and easy enough to port to different languages, while still having enough functionality to test other languages and frameworks to a reasonable degree, such as:

- Mutiple screens
- Screen transitions
- Sprites
- Animations
- Scrolling backgrounds
- Custom fonts
- Music

Implementing all of these in each language should give me a good enough idea how much I like programming in the language and framework.

## Languages and frameworks

These are the ones I plan on doing at the moment, but it may change.

- [x] C and [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)
- [x] C++ and [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)
- [x] [love2d](https://www.love2d.org/) - partial, see project README
- [ ] [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
- [ ] ~[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)~ - won't do, would be too similar to love2d
- [ ] ~[Ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/)~ - won't do, would be too similar to love2d

### Why did you choose these?

- I like writing code and so want to write code.
- I'm not currently interested in too much drag and drop development.
- I want to use different languages.

## Playing the game

You can actually play the game here. I'll try to keep the itch.io page updated with a note as to which version of the game is running.
